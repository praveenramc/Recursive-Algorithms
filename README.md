# Recursive-Algorithms
The repository contains few recursive algorithms that are taught in Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms Class at University of Texas at Dallas.

Contains the following Recursive Algorithms
<li>
1. Recursive Algorithm Fibonacci Numbers </li>
2. Comparison of sorting algorithms
3. Selection problem

1. Recursive Algorithm to Compute the power
Input: Two numbers, n (long) and p (int).  Output: Fib(n) mod p.
Here, Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 1.  Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), for n>1.
The input may be given on the command line, or in standard input (console).
Compare the performance of the straight-forward O(n) algorithm with the
divide and conquer algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Sample input:
1234567890  997

Output:
241 <Time taken by O(n) algorithm> <Time taken by O(log n) algorithm>
